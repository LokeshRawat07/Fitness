            </h1>
            <p>Congratulations on taking a forward step to get in shape and feel great. Many people are guilty of
                wishing they could get a sculpted body from eating junk food and watching TV all day. But that is just
                not going to happen. Even though getting in shape sounds like a long, time-wasting process, the effort
                put towards being in shape has many positive effects. If you want to start your journey to having a
                better body to feel great, here are some tips:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li class="">1.Exercise Daily</li>
                <p>Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc.,
                    but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking
                    to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk
                    pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure
                    you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high
                    intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be
                    sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout.
                    The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.</p>
                <li>2.Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal</li>
                <p>No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away
                    from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar,
                    one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting
                    into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4
                    hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and
                    running.Also, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and tilapia are
                    also great alternatives. These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles
                    fit and ready for workouts. In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism
                    comes from portioning meals. Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions,
                    rather than having three large meals throughout the day. This will also help you find yourself
                    breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. This is because you
                    will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise.

                </p>
                <li>3.Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day</li>
                <p>Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical
                    exercising. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out
                    their meals and take in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing
                    weight and striving for a skinnier physique will involve more physical exercise than calories you
                    ingest.</p>
                <li>4.Be Sure to Get Sleep</li>
                <p>Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough
                    sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going
                    throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all
                    means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about a half hour. This will
                    prevent you from staying up later in the night.</p>
                <li>5.Stay Motivated</li>
                <p>An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive,
                    you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.</p>
